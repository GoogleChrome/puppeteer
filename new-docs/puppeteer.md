## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [Accessibility](./puppeteer.accessibility.md) | The Accessibility class provides methods for inspecting Chromium's accessibility tree. The accessibility tree is used by assistive technology such as [screen readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) or [switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access)<!-- -->.<!-- -->Accessibility is a very platform-specific thing. On different platforms, there are different screen readers that might have wildly different output.<!-- -->Blink - Chrome's rendering engine - has a concept of "accessibility tree", which is then translated into different platform-specific APIs. Accessibility namespace gives users access to the Blink Accessibility Tree.<!-- -->Most of the accessibility tree gets filtered out when converting from Blink AX Tree to Platform-specific AX-Tree or by assistive technologies themselves. By default, Puppeteer tries to approximate this filtering, exposing only the "interesting" nodes of the tree. |
