# WebDriver BiDi for Chromium Prototype

This is an experimental prototype of the [WebDriver BiDi](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/) protocol for Chromium, implemented as a JavaScript layer translating between BiDi and CDP. It is based on (forked from) [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) for use of its CDP abstractions, but isn't intended for use as a JavaScript client library.
